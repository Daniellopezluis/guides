## File Handling in C

A file is a representation of a sequence of bytes, on the disk, where a group of data is stored. Files are created for permanent storage.

In C language, a pointer of file type structure is used to declare a file. 

```c
FILE *fp
```
C provides a number of functions to help perform basic file operations. The following are some of them:

| **Function**  |**Description**|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| fopen()       | create a new file or open an existing file |
| fclose()      | closes a file                              |
| getc()        | reads a character from a file              |
| putc()        | writes a character to a file               |
